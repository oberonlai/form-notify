== 🧰Installation ==

First, download the plugin from the following link: https://wordpress.org/plugins/form-notify/

Find the plugin from the WordPress dashboard and click “Activate.” After activation, you will see the “Form Notify” menu in the sidebar of the admin.

**Setting Up LINE Login and LINE Channel**

Navigate to Form Notify > Settings, and select the LINE Channel tab:

Here, you will need to retrieve the LINE Login and LINE Messaging API Channel information from the LINE Developer Console. You can refer to the following guides for detailed instructions:

[LINE Login Getting Started](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/line-login/getting-started/)
[Channel Access Token](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/basics/channel-access-token/)

**Designing the Login Page and Form Fields**

Create a new page to add the LINE login button, or you can insert it anywhere in your posts using the block editor. In the block editor, type a slash / followed by “LINE Login” to find the LINE Login Button widget. Alternatively, click the plus sign in the upper left corner, navigate to the widgets category, and add the LINE Login button:

Once added, you can adjust the button style through the settings on the right-hand side:

If you’re not using the block editor, you can insert the login button using a shortcode. Here’s how to use it:

[form_notify_linelogin text="Quick Login" size="m" lgmode="true"]

Shortcode: form_notify_linelogin
* Parameters:
* text: The button text.
* size: Button size, with options: f (full-width), l, m, s.
* lgmode: The redirect mode; if set to true, it redirects back to the original page. If set to a URL, it redirects to that page.
* align: Alignment options: left, center, right.

If the user is already logged in, the login button will not be displayed on the front end.

For the form demonstration, we use Elementor Form. Design three fields: Name, Email, and a radio button for selecting a session.

**Editing the Push Notification Content**

Go to Form Notify > Add New in the WordPress admin dashboard. Enter a title for the page, select the trigger event as “After Elementor Form Submission”, and choose the form you just created. Then click the “Add Notification Method” button below:

In the next step, add the message content for the notification. Select the type as LINE Push Notification, and copy the required data from the Available Parameters section on the right. Paste the recipient’s email in the Custom Push Notification Field. The system will automatically detect if the email is associated with a LINE User ID via LINE Login and will push the message to the associated LINE official account:

**Testing the Notification Reception**

After logging in via LINE on the front end and submitting the form, ensure that LINE receives the registration information.
